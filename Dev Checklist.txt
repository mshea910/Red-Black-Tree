Red Black Tree Implementation

1. Create Red Black Tree
    - Create data structure class
    - Create Balance method
        -- Each Node is either Red or Black
        -- The Root Node is Black
        -- All NIL Leaves are Black
        -- Red Node must not have Red children
        -- All Paths from a Node to the Leaves below must contain the same number of Black Nodes
    - Create Insertion method
        -- Insert Node
        -- Balance
    - Create Find method
    - Override < Comparison Operator for checking
    - Override = Comparison Operator for checking

2. Adjust Red Black Tree to Use as Template

3. Create Testing Class for Timings
    - Use Chrono Header: http://cplusplus.com/reference/chrono

4. Create "Black Height" Function
    - Recursive function 
    - Checks if tree has same number of black nodes along the simple path

5. Simplify with Nil Nodes

6. (Extra Credit) Implement Deletion
